Yeah, this is the nobody-cares place. Anyway, welcome!

(Did you know, that, building a full gentoo system on a consumer ARM development
board is kind of time consuming?

And, sadly, `distcc` doesn't help very much here - even if some x86-64 monster
tries to help... - 'cause the ARM board isn't fast enough to preprocess source
code files at the speed the other CPU monster compiles them.  
Qemu userland emulation is even slower and have some issues...  
Fully crosscompiling the system on a faster board is a bit delicate...  
Well, I'll just take the good old [compiling excuse](https://xkcd.com/303/).)

Nyanly yours.
